# CSM182: Dynamic System Modeling and Simulations with Simulink

This repository showcases projects from UCLA's CSM182 course, focusing on dynamic system modeling and simulations using Simulink.

**Early Projects:**
- **Simulink Fundamentals:** Initial projects introduce basic Simulink operations and model systems with various equations and operators.

**Advanced Projects:**
- **Multivariable Calculus:** Explores dynamic systems involving multiple species and concepts such as floor capacity.
- **Biochemical Systems:** Includes simulations of glucose reactions and other biochemical processes.
- **Electrical Systems Modeling:** Analyzes and simulates electrical system dynamics.
- **Epidemic Spread:** Models and assesses epidemic spread rates and mitigation strategies.

These projects demonstrate the application of Simulink to complex, real-world systems, showcasing capabilities in dynamic and life-simulation modeling.
